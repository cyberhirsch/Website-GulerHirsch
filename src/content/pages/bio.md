### Artistic Statement

"My art explores the intersection of anthropomorphic forms and ceramic vessels. While my earlier works placed human elements distinctly in the foreground, today I express these themes more subtly. Inspired by the rich history of ceramics, I combine traditional techniques with modern approaches... My art celebrates the versatility of this ancient craft and invites viewers to experience it from a new, contemporary perspective."
